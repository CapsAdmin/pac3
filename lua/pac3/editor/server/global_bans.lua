	I might remove these bans later on (maybe once a year)
	If you feel you have been banned for the wrong reasons contact me (CapsAdmin) on steam.

		Has gone around begging for pac outfits and then claiming he made these outfits
		himself behind the real author's back. Eventually he released all the outfits that were 
		given to him. (and some he found online that were public already) and claimed he hacked 
		everyone's computer to get these outfits causing terror.
		
		This ban is mostly becasuse he's been running around taking credit for outfits he didn't make.
		And the whole being a dick about it in the process.
