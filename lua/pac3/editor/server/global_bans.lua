This used to be uncommented for a long time but I don't believe it's ethical anymore.
Bans should be between servers.

example:

pace.GlobalBans = {
	["STEAM_0:1:27361650"] = [[
		Has gone around begging for pac outfits and then claiming he made these outfits
		himself behind the real author's back. Eventually he released all the outfits that were
		given to him. (and some he found online that were public already) and claimed he hacked
		everyone's computer to get these outfits causing terror.

		This ban is mostly becasuse he's been running around taking credit for outfits he didn't make.
		And the whole being a dick about it in the process.
	]],

	[{"STEAM_0:1:49726468", "STEAM_0:1:86041797", "STEAM_0:0:86122136", "4284050078"}] = [[
		Constantly taking credit for outfits other people have made that he found on pastebins even though
		he has been called out for it countless of times and being an asshole about it at the same time.
	]],
}
